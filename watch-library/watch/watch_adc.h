                   or 1024. Any other value will be ignored.
  * @details The SAM L22's ADC has a resolution of 12 bits. By default, the watch configures
  *          the ADC to take 16 samples of the analog input and accumulate them in the result
  *          register; this effectively gives us a 16-bit resolution, at the cost of taking 16
  *          ADC cycles to complete a measurement. If you are measuring a slowly changing signal
  *          like a thermistor output or an ambient light sensor this is probably fine, even
  *          desirable. If you are measuring something a bit more fast-paced, like an analog
  *          accelerometer, you may wish to exchange precision for speed. In this case you may
  *          call this function to configure the ADC to accumulate fewer samples. HOWEVER! Note
  *          that this may change the range of values returned from watch_get_analog_pin_level:
  *            - For watch_set_num_analog_samples(1), the returned value will be 12 bits (0-4095).
  *            - For watch_set_num_analog_samples(2), the returned value will be 13 bits (0-8191).
  *            - For watch_set_num_analog_samples(4), the returned value will be 14 bits (0-16383).
  *            - For watch_set_num_analog_samples(8), the returned value will be 15 bits (0-32767).
  *         For sampling values over 16, the returned value will still be 16 bits (0-65535); the
  *         ADC will automatically divide the measured value by whatever factor is necessary to fit
  *         the result in 16 bits.

void watch_set_analog_num_samples(uint16_t samples);

/** @brief Sets the length of time spent sampling, which allows measurement of higher impedance inputs.
  *        Default is 1.
  * @param cycles The number of ADC cycles to sample, between 1 and 64.
  * @see this article by Thea Flowers: https://blog.thea.codes/getting-the-most-out-of-the-samd21-adc/
  *      which is where I learned all of this.
  * @details To measure an analog value, the SAM L22 must charge a capacitor to the analog voltage
  *          presented at the input. This takes time. Importantly, the higher the input impedance,
  *          the more time this takes. As a basic example: if you are using a thermistor tied to
  *          VCC to measure temperature, the capacitor has to charge through the thermistor. The
  *          higher the resistor value, the higher the input impedance, and the more time we need
  *          to allow for the measurement. By default, the ADC is configured to run on a 500 kHz
  *          clock with a sample time of one cycle. This is appropriate for an input impedance up
  *          to about 28kΩ. Setting the sampling time to 4 cycles allows for an input impedance up
  *          to 123kΩ. Setting the sampling time to the maximum of 64 cycles theoretically allows
  *          for input impedance up to 2 MΩ. (I based these numbers on the calculator in the linked
  *          blog post; it also has a ton of great info on the SAM D21 ADC, which is similar to the
  *          SAM L22's).

/** @brief Selects the reference voltage to use for analog readings. Default is ADC_REFERENCE_VCC.

  *                  or ADC_REFERENCE_INTREF.
  * @details In order to turn an analog voltage into a 16-bit integer, the ADC needs to compare the
  *          measured voltage to a reference point. For example, if you were powering the watch with
  *          VCC == 3.0V and you had two 10K resistors connected in series from 3V to GND, you could
  *          expect to get 3 volts when you measure the top of the voltage divider, 0 volts at the
  *          bottom, and 1.5 volts in the middle. If you read these values uising a reference voltage
  *          of ADC_REFERENCE_VCC, the top value would be about 65535, the bottom about 0, and the
  *          middle about 32768. However! If we used ADC_REFERENCE_VCC_DIV2 as our reference, we would
  *          expect to get 65535 both at the top and the middle, because the largest value the ADC can
  *          measure in this configutation is 1.5V (VCC / 2).
  *
  *          By changing the reference voltage from ADC_REFERENCE_VCC to ADC_REFERENCE_VCC_DIV1POINT6
  *          or ADC_REFERENCE_VCC_DIV2, you can get more resolution when measuring small voltages (i.e.
  *          a phototransistor circuit in low light).
  *
  *          There is also a special reference voltage called ADC_REFERENCE_INTREF. The SAM L22's
  *          Supply Controller provides a selectable voltage reference (by default, 1.024 V) that you
  *          can select as a reference voltage for ADC conversions. Unlike the three references we
  *          talked about in the last paragraph, this reference voltage does not depend on VCC, which
  *          makes it very useful for measuring the battery voltage (since you can't really compare
  *          VCC to itself). You can change the INTREF voltage to 2.048 or 4.096 V by poking at the
  *          supply controller's VREF register, but the watch library does not support this use case.

/** @brief Returns the voltage of the VCC supply in millivolts (i.e. 3000 mV == 3.0 V). If running on

  * @details Unlike other ADC functions, this function does not return a raw value from the ADC, but
  *          rather scales it to an actual number of millivolts. This is because the ADC doesn't let
  *          us measure VCC per se; it instead lets us measure VCC / 4, and we choose to measure it
  *          against the internal reference voltage of 1.024 V. In short, the ADC gives us a number
  *          that's complicated to deal with, so we just turn it into a useful number for you :)
