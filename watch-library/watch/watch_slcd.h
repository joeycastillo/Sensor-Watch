/** @addtogroup slcd Segment LCD Display
  * @brief This section covers functions related to the Segment LCD display driver, which is responsible
  *        for displaying strings of characters and indicators on the main watch display.
  * @details The segment LCD controller consumes about 3 microamperes of power with no segments on, and
  *          about 4 microamperes with all segments on. There is also a slight power impact associated
  *          with updating the screen (about 1 microampere to update at 1 Hz). For the absolute lowest
  *          power operation, update the display only when its contents have changed, and disable the
  *          SLCD peripheral when the screen is not in use.
  *          For a map of all common and segment pins, see <a href="segmap.html">segmap.html</a>. You can
  *          hover over any segment in that diagram to view the common and segment pins associated with
  *          each segment of the display.
