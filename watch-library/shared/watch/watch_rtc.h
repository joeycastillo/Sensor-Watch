/** @addtogroup rtc Real-Time Clock
  * @brief This section covers functions related to the SAM L22's real-time clock peripheral, including
  *        date, time and alarm functions.
  * @details The real-time clock is the only peripheral that main.c enables for you. It is the cornerstone
  *          of low power operation on the watch, and it is required for several key functions that we
  *          assume will be available, namely the wake from BACKUP mode and the callback on the ALARM button.
  *          It is also required for the operation of the 1 Hz tick interrupt, which you will most likely use
  *          to wake from STANDBY mode.

  * @note A 1 Hz tick (@see watch_rtc_register_tick_callback) is suitable for most applications, in that it gives you a

  *       power your app will consume. Ideally you should enable the fast tick only when the user requires it (i.e. in
  *       response to an input event), and move back to the slow tick after some time.
  *
  *       Also note that the RTC peripheral does not have sub-second resolution, so even if you set a 2 or 4 Hz interval,
