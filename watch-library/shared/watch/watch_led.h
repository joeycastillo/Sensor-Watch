/** @addtogroup led LED Control
  * @brief This section covers functions related to the bi-color red/green LED mounted behind the LCD.
  * @details The SAM L22 is an exceedingly power efficient chip, whereas the LED's are relatively power-
  *          hungry. The green LED, at full power, consumes more power than the whole chip in active mode,
  *          and the red LED consumes about twelve times as much power! The LED's should thus be used only
  *          sparingly in order to preserve battery life.
  * @note Some watches use a red/blue LED instead of a red/green LED. You will be able to determine this
  *       easily when you double tap the reset button: if the pulsing bootloader LED is red, you have a
  *       red/green edition; if it is blue, you have a red/blue edition. For red/blue watches, build your
  *       project with the command `make COLOR=BLUE`, and the watch library will automatically swap the pins
  *       so that watch_set_led_red sets the red LED, and watch_set_led_green sets the blue one.

  *       your app is asleep. If, however, you set a custom color using watch_set_led_color, the color will
  *       not display correctly in STANDBY mode. You will need to keep your app running while the LED is on.
