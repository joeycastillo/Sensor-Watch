// There is a lot of busy-waiting in here that involves synchronizing stuff between the main CPU and the timer

// This command gets executed on the next TC clock cycle, which is running at 1024hz, meaning the CPU might be spinning
// for up to a millisecond just to read the value from the counter.

// This is somewhat unfortunate, because interrupt triggering is much faster than that. I was having trouble with the
// ISR on compare events because I'd schedule an event at like, t=1000, but when I called watch_hpt_get() from inside
// the ISR, I would get some lower value like t=996.

// After adding the appropriate busy-wait checks for synchronization, it started coming back correct. If I scheduled a
// callback at T=1000, I could call watch_hpt_get() inside the ISR and it would return T=1005. A later timestamp is
// fine, but does this mean that the CPU was just spinning for 5 milliseconds waiting for the timer?
