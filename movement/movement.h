// Movement Preferences
// These four 32-bit structs store information about the wearer and their preferences. Tentatively, the plan is
// for Movement to use four 32-bit registers for these preferences and to store them in the RTC's backup registers
// 0-3, leaving registers 4-7 available for third party watch faces to use as they see fit.
// * The movement_settings_t struct is provided to all watch faces in the callback functions, and is stored in the
//   RTC's first backup register (BKUP[0]).
// * The movement_location_t and movement_birthdate_t types are defined here, and are tentatively meant to be
//   stored in BKUP[1] and BKUP[2], respectively.
// * The movement_reserved_t type is here as a placeholder, because I sense there's some other generally useful
//   stuff we'll want to make available to all watch faces and stash in the BKUP[3] register.
// This allows these preferences to be stored before entering BACKUP mode and and restored after waking from reset.

// movement_settings_t contains global settings that cover watch behavior, including preferences around clock and unit
// display, time zones, buzzer behavior, LED color and low energy mode timeouts. These settings are stored in BKUP[0].
// If your watch face changes one of these settings, you should store your changes in either your loop or resign
// function by calling `watch_store_backup_data(settings->reg, 0)`. Otherwise it may not persist after a reset event.

/** @brief Perform setup for your watch face.
  * @details It's tempting to say this is 'one-time' setup, but technically this function is called more than
  *          once. When the watch first boots, this function is called with a NULL context_ptr, indicating
  *          that it is the first run. At this time you should set context_ptr to something non-NULL if you
  *          need to keep track of any state in your watch face. If your watch face requires any other setup,
  *          like configuring a pin mode or a peripheral, you may want to do that here too.
  *          This function will be called again after waking from sleep mode, since sleep mode disables all
  *          of the device's pins and peripherals.
  * @param settings A pointer to the global Movement settings. You can use this to inform how you present your
  *                 display to the user (i.e. taking into account whether they have silenced the buttons, or if
  *                 they prefer 12 or 24-hour mode). You can also change these settings if you like.
  * @param watch_face_index The index of this watch face in the global array of watch faces; 0 is the first face,
  *                         1 is the second, etc. You may stash this value in your context if you wish to reference
  *                         it later; your watch face's index is set at launch and will not change.
  * @param context_ptr A pointer to a pointer; at first invocation, this value will be NULL, and you can set it
  *                    to any value you like. Subsequent invocations will pass in whatever value you previously
  *                    set. You may want to check if this is NULL and if so, allocate some space to store any
  *                    data required for your watch face.

  *          watch face depends on data from a peripheral (like an I2C sensor), you will likely want to enable

/** @brief Handle events and update the display.
  * @details This function is called in response to an event. You should set up a switch statement that handles,
  *          at the very least, the EVENT_TICK and EVENT_MODE_BUTTON_UP event types. The tick event happens once
  *          per second (or more frequently if you asked for a faster tick with movement_request_tick_frequency).
  *          The mode button up event occurs when the user presses the MODE button. **Your loop function SHOULD
  *          call the movement_move_to_next_face function in response to this event.** If you have a good reason
  *          to override this behavior (e.g. your user interface requires all three buttons), your watch face MUST
  *          call the movement_move_to_next_face function in response to the EVENT_MODE_LONG_PRESS event. If you
  *          fail to do this, the user will become stuck on your watch face.
  * @param event A struct containing information about the event, including its type. `movement_event_type_t`
  *              for a list of all possible event types.
  * @param settings A pointer to the global Movement settings. See `watch_face_setup`.
  * @param context A pointer to your application's context. See `watch_face_setup`.
  * @return true if your watch face is prepared for the system to enter STANDBY mode; false to keep the system awake.
  *         You should almost always return true.
  *         Note that this return value has no effect if your loop function has called movement_move_to_next_face
  *         or movement_move_to_face; in that case, your watch face will resign immediately, and the next watch
  *         face will make the decision on entering standby mode.
  * @note There are three event types that require some extra thought:
          The EVENT_LOW_ENERGY_UPDATE event type is a special case. If you are in the foreground when the watch
          goes into low energy mode, you will receive this tick once a minute (at the top of the minute) so that
          you can update the screen. Great! But! When you receive this event, all pins and peripherals other than
          the RTC will have been disabled to save energy. If your display is clock or calendar oriented, this is
          fine. But if your display requires polling an I2C sensor or reading a value with the ADC, you won't be
          able to do this. You should either display the name of the watch face in response to the low power tick,
          or ensure that you resign before low power mode triggers, (e.g. by calling movement_move_to_face(0)).
          **Your watch face MUST NOT wake up peripherals in response to a low power tick.** The purpose of this
          mode is to consume as little energy as possible during the (potentially long) intervals when it's
          unlikely the user is wearing or looking at the watch.
          EVENT_BACKGROUND_TASK is also a special case. watch_face_wants_background_task for details.
          EVENT_HPT is similar to EVENT_BACKGROUND_TASK, but it is triggered by the HPT system, rather than the
          RTC. See `movement_hpt_schedule` for details.

  *          frequency other than the standard 1 Hz, **you must call movement_request_tick_frequency(1) here**
  *          to reset to 1 Hz. You should also disable any peripherals you enabled when you entered the foreground.
  * @param settings A pointer to the global Movement settings. @see watch_face_setup.

/** @brief OPTIONAL. Request an opportunity to run a background task.
  * @details Most apps will not need this function, but if you provide it, Movement will call it once per minute in
  *          both active and low power modes, regardless of whether your app is in the foreground. You can check the
  *          current time to determine whether you require a background task. If you return true here, Movement will
  *          immediately call your loop function with an EVENT_BACKGROUND_TASK event. Note that it will not call your
  *          activate or deactivate functions, since you are not going on screen.
  *
  *          Examples of background tasks:
  *           - Wake and play a sound when an alarm or timer has been triggered.
  *           - Check the state of an RTC interrupt pin or the timestamp of an RTC interrupt event.
  *           - Log a data point from a sensor, and then return to sleep mode.
  *
  *          Guidelines for background tasks:
  *           - Assume all peripherals and pins other than the RTC will be disabled when you get an EVENT_BACKGROUND_TASK.
  *           - Even if your background task involves only the RTC peripheral, try to request background tasks sparingly.
  *           - If your background task involves an external pin or peripheral, request background tasks no more than once per hour.
  *           - If you need to enable a pin or a peripheral to perform your task, return it to its original state afterwards.
  *
  * @param settings A pointer to the global Movement settings. @see watch_face_setup.
  * @param context A pointer to your application's context. @see watch_face_setup.
