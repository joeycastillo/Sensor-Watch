/*
 * Simple Calculator
 *
 * How to use:
 *
 * Important note: LONG PRESS MODE to move to next watch face
 *
 * Flow:
 * Enter first number -> Select operator -> Enter second number -> View Results
 * 
 * How to read the display:
 * - "CA" is displayed at the top to tell you that you're in the CAlculator
 * - The top-right digit (1, 2, or 3) lets you know whether you're entering the
 *   first number (1), entering the second number (2), or viewing the results (3).
 * - To the right of the top-right digit will show the number's sign. If the
 *   number is negative, a "-" will be displayed, otherwise it is empty.
 * - The 4 large digits to the left are whole numbers and the 2 smaller digits
 *   on the right are the tenths and hundredths decimal places.
 *
 * Entering the first number:
 * - Press ALARM to increment the selected (blinking) digit
 * - Press LIGHT to move to the next placeholder
 * - LONG PRESS the LIGHT button to toggle the number's sign to make it 
 *   negative
 * - LONG PRESS the ALARM button to reset the number to 0
 * - Press MODE to proceed to selecting the operator
 *
 * Selecting the operator:
 * - Press the LIGHT button to cycle through available operators. They are:
 *   + Add
 *   - Subtract
 *   * Multiply
 *   / Divide
 *   sqrtf() Square root
 *   powf() Power (exponent calculation)
 * - Press MODE or ALARM to proceed to entering the second number
 *
 * Entering the second number:
 * - Everything is the same as setting the first number except that pressing
 *   MODE here will proceed to viewing the results
 *
 * Viewing the results:
 * - Pressing MODE will start a new calculation with the result as the first
 *   number. (LONG PRESS ALARM to reset the value to 0)
 *
 * Errors:
 * - An error will be triggered if the result is not able to be displayed, that
 * is, if the value is greater than 9,999.99 or less than -9,999.99.
 * - An error will also be triggered if an impossible operation is selected,
 *   for instance trying to divide by 0 or get the square root of a negative
 *   number.
 * - Exit error mode and start over with any button press.
