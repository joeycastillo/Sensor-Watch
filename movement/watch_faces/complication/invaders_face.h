/*
 * Remake of the "famous" Casio Number Invaders Game
 *
 * This is an authentic remake of the invaders game, found on the Casio
 * calculator wristwatch CA-85 or CA-851. There were also some calculators
 * sold with this game, like MG-880.
 * 
 * How to play:
 * 
 * Press the alarm button to start the game.
 * "Invaders" (just digits, tbh) will start coming in from the right hand side.
 * Press the light button to "aim". The digit on the top of the display cycles
 * from 0 to 9. If your aiming digit is identical to one of the invaders,
 * press the alarm button to "shoot". The corresponding invader will disappear.
 * If the invaders reach beneath the very first position, you loose one defense 
 * line. When all three defense lines are gone, the game is over.
 * Also: If you shoot more than 29 times per round, you loose the game.
 * Good to know: There are 16 invaders per wave. There is a short break between
 * waves.
 * 
 * What are the "n" invaders? Ufos!
 * 
 * Whenever the sum of all invaders shot is divisible by 10 the next invader 
 * will be an ufo, represented by the n-symbol. Shooting a ufo gets you extra
 * points. Example: shoot 2, 5, 3 --> ufo next
 * 
 * As for points: the earlier you shoot an invader, the more points you get.
 *
 * Anything else? Long pressing the light button toggles sound on or off. (Not
 * while playing.)
 *
