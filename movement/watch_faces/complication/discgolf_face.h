/* 
 * Keep track of scores in discgolf or golf!
 * The watch face operates in three different modes:
 *
 *  - dg_setting: Select a course
 *      Enter this mode by holding down the light button. The screen will display
 *      the label for the hole and the lowest score since last boot. 
 *      Press alarm to loop through the holes. Press the light button to make a 
 *      selection. This will reset all scores and start a new game in dg_idle mode.
 *
 *  -dg_idle: We're playing a hole
 *      This either shows your current score relative to par, or the score for a
 *      particular hole. 
 *      At the start of a game, press alarm to loop through the holes and leave it
 *      your starting hole. For optimal experience, play the course linearly after that
 *      If you're viewing the hole you're supposed to be playing, the watch face will
 *      display your score relative to par.
 *      Use the alarm button to view other holes than the one you're playing, in which
 *      case the input score for that hole will be displayed, in case it needs changing.
 *      Long press the alarm button to snap back to currently playing hole.
 *      To input scores for a hole in this mode, press the light button.
 *
 *  -dg_scoring: Input score for a hole
 *      In this mode, if the score is 0 (hasn't been entered during this round),
 *      it will blink, indicating we're in scoring mode. Press the alarm button
 *      to increment the score up until 15, in which case it loops back to 0. 
 *      Press the light button to save the score for that hole, advance one hole
 *      if you're not editing an already input score, and returning to idle mode.
 *
 *  When all scores have been entered, the LAP indicator turns on. At that point, if we enter 
 *  dg_setting to select a course, the score for that round is evaluated against the current 
 *  lowest score for that course, and saved if it is better.
