/*
 * Advanced timer/countdown face with pre-set timer lengths
 * 
 * This watch face provides the functionality of starting a countdown by choosing 
 * one out of nine programmable timer presets. A timer/countdown can be 23 hours,
 * 59 minutes, and 59 seconds max. A timer can also be set to auto-repeat, which
 * is indicated by the lap indicator.
 *
 * How to use in NORMAL mode:
 *   - Short-pressing the alarm button cycles through all pre-set timer lengths.
 *     Find the current timer slot number in the upper right-hand corner.
 *   - Long-pressing the alarm button starts the timer.
 *   - Long-pressing the light button initiates settings mode.
 * 
 * How to use in SETTINGS mode:
 *   - There are up to nine slots for storing a timer setting. The current slot is 
 *     indicated by the number in the upper right-hand corner.
 *   - Short-pressing the light button cycles through the settings values of each
 *     timer slot in the following order: hours - minutes - seconds - timer repeat
 *   - Short-pressing the alarm button alters the current settings value.
 *   - Long-pressing the light button resumes to normal mode.
