 * TEMPERATURE CHART face
 *
 * Gathers temperature statistics in a chart form.
 * Statistics bins are per hour / per 0.5Â°C.
 *
 * Saved to file every day at 00:00.
 * Can help improve watch precision in the future. 
 *
 * If you can gather statistics over few months, and then send "tempchart.ini"
 * to "3@14.by", it will help future generations of precision quartz watches.
