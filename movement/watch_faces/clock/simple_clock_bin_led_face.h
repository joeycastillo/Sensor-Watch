/*
 * A "fork" of the simple clock face, which provides the functionality of showing 
 * the current time by flashing the LED using binary representation.
 *
 * This feature serves as a practical solution to compensate for the admittedly 
 * subpar backlight of the F91w watch and is especially useful if your eyesight
 * is not the best. By pressing and holding the light button long enough, the
 * watch will illuminate the LED to showcase the current time.
 *
 * How to interpret the flashing led:
 * - Firstly, the hour is presented as a binary number, with the lowest bit displayed
 *   first. A short flash signifies 0, while a longer flash represents 1. If you use
 *   the watch in 24h mode, please note that the indicated value may be decreased 
 *   by 12, to keep things simple and short. For example, 22h would be translated
 *   to 10h.
 * - After showing the hour, a lengthier  pause indicates that minutes will be shown 
 *   next.
 * - Similar to the hour representation, minutes are displayed in binary format, 
 *   starting with the lowest bits. A short flash denotes 0, a longer flash 
 *   represents 1.
