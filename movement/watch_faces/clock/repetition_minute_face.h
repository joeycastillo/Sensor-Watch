/*
 * A hopefully useful complication for friendly neighbors in the dark
 *
 * Originating from 1676 from reverend and mechanician Edward Barlow, and
 * perfected in 1820 by neighbor Abraham Breguet, a minute repeater or 
 * "repetition minute" is a complication in a mechanical watch or clock that
 * chimes the hours and often minutes at the press of a button. There are many
 * types of repeater, from the simple repeater which merely strikes the number
 * of hours, to the minute repeater which chimes the time down to the minute,
 * using separate tones for hours, quarter hours, and minutes. They originated
 * before widespread artificial illumination, to allow the time to be determined
 * in the dark, and were also used by the visually impaired. 
 *
 *
 * How to use it :
 * 
 * Long press the light button to get an auditive reading of the time like so :
 * 0..23 (1..12 if 24-hours format isn't enabled) low beep(s) for the hours
 * 0..3 low-high couple pitched beeps for the quarters
 * 0..14 high pitched beep(s) for the remaining minutes
 *
 * Prerequisite : a watch with a working buzzer
 * 
 * ~ Only in the darkness can you see the stars. - Martin Luther King ~
