/*
Slowly render the current time from left to right, 
scanning across its liquid crystal face, completing 1 cycle every 2 seconds.

Created to mimic the wyoscan watch that was produced by Halmos and designed by Dexter Sinister
It looks like this https://www.o-r-g.com/apps/wyoscan

Youâ€™ll notice that reading this watch requires more attention than usual, 
as the seven segments of each digit are lit one by one across its display. 
This speed may be adjusted until it reaches the limits of your perception. 
You and your watch are now in tune.

This is a relatively generic way of animating a time display.
If you want to modify the animation, you can change the segment_map
the A-F are corresponding to the segments on the watch face
  A  
F   B
  G
E   C
  D
the X's are the frames that will be skipped in the animation
This particular segment_map allocates 8 frames to display each number
this is to achieve the 2 second cycle time.
8 frames per number * 6 numbers + the trailing 16 frames = 64 frames
at 32 frames per second, this is a 2 second cycle time.

I tried to make the animation of each number display similar to if you were 
to draw the number on the watch face with a pen, pausing with 'X'
when your pen might turn a corner or when you might cross over 
a line you've already drawn. It is vaguely top to bottom and counter,
clockwise when possible.
