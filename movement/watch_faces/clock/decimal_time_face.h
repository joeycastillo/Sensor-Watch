/*
 * DECIMAL TIME FACE
 * 
 * This face presents the current time as hours and hundredths of an hour. Every hundreth of an hour, or "centihour", 
 * occurs every 36 seconds. Because they range from 0 to 99, centihours, in the seventies range, will be displayed with a lowercase 7.
 * 
 * See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time#Decimal_hours
 *  
 * This method of timekeeping is used by the United States Postal Service.

 * https://postalemployeenetwork.com/time-conversion-print.htm
 * 
 * This method may be used by other organizations as well
