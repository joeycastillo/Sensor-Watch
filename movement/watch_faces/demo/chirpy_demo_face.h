/*
 * CHIRPY DEMO FACE
 * 
 * This face demonstrates the chirpy-tx library. It is intended to help you
 * include chirpy-tx in your own watch faces that need to transmit data out
 * of the watch.
 * 
 * The face's first screen lets you select from a few built-in transmissions:
 * 
 * SCALE cycles through frequencies in fixed increments. This is intended to
 * collect and analyze audio samples from different watches. With this info
 * it may be possible to improve chirpy-tx's parameters like the frequencies
 * it uses to make the method more robust.
 * 
 * SHORT is a small transmission that contains data taked from the activity_face.
 * 
 * LONG is a longer transmission that contains the first two strophes of a
 * famous sea shanty.
 * 
 * Select the transmission you want with ALARM, the press LONG ALARM to chirp.
 * 
 * To record and decode a chirpy transmission on your computer, you can use the web app here:
 * https://jealousmarkup.xyz/off/chirpy/rx/
