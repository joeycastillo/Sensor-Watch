/** @addtogroup buttons Buttons & External Interrupts
  * @brief This section covers functions related to the three buttons: Light, Mode and Alarm, as well as
  *        external interrupts from devices on the nine-pin connector.
  * @details The buttons are the core input UI of the watch, and the way the user will interact with
  *          your application. They are active high, pulled down by the microcontroller, and triggered
  *          when one of the "pushers" brings a tab from the metal frame into contact with the edge
  *          of the board. Note that the buttons can only wake the watch from STANDBY mode, at least as
  *          of the current SAM L22 silicon revision. The external interrupt controller runs in STANDBY
  *          mode, but it does not run in BACKUP mode; to wake from BACKUP, buttons will not cut it.

/** @brief Configures an external interrupt callback on one of the external interrupt pins.
  * @details You can set one interrupt callback per pin, and you can monitor for a rising condition,
  *          a falling condition, or both. If you just want to detect a button press, register your
  *          interrupt with INTERRUPT_TRIGGER_RISING; if you want to detect an active-low interrupt
  *          signal from a device on the nine-pin connector, use INTERRUPT_TRIGGER_FALLING. If you
  *          want to detect both rising and falling conditions (i.e. button down and button up), use
  *          INTERRUPT_TRIGGER_BOTH and use watch_get_pin_level to check the pin level in your callback
  *          to determine which condition caused the interrupt.
  * @param pin One of BTN_LIGHT, BTN_MODE, BTN_ALARM, A0, A1, A3 or A4. If the pin parameter matches one of
  *            the three button pins, this function will also enable an internal pull-down resistor. If
  *            the pin parameter is A0-A4, you are responsible for setting any required pull configuration
  *            using watch_enable_pull_up or watch_enable_pull_down.
  * @param callback The function you wish to have called when the button is pressed.
  * @param trigger The condition on which you wish to trigger: rising, falling or both.
  * @note Pins A2 and A4 can also generate interrupts via the watch_register_extwake_callback function, which
  *       will allow them to trigger even when the watch is in deep sleep mode.
  * @warning As of now, A2 is not usable via the watch_register_interrupt_callback function. To enable an
  *          external interrupt on pin A2, use the watch_register_extwake_callback function. This issue will be
  *          addressed in a future revision of the watch library.
