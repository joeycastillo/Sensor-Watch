XYZZY Micro-adventure.

A lightning-quick tribute to the original game.

Full acknowledgements to Will Crowther 1976 and Don Woods 1977 for
"Colossal Cave Adventure", which started this genre of games.

Tiny cave hint: The keywords always appear at locations 3 and 6.

Thankfully; keywords only appear on the main path in all caves.
