This algorithm employs wheel factorization to consider only 16 candidate numbers per
each block of 60 seconds.  Details are here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization

The known downside is that for users that prefer 24 hour time, the first three
prime values after midnight,  00:00:02, 00:00:03, 00:00:05, are not displayed.
All other values are correct.
